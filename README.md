# Password Manager GUI Tkinter Project

This Python application utilizes the `tkinter` library to create a user-friendly graphical interface for managing passwords. 
Users can generate secure passwords, save them along with their associated website information and retrieve stored passwords.

## Key Features

**Password Generation:**
  - The application generates a random password based on user-defined criteria, including the number of letters, symbols and numbers.

**Saving Passwords:**
  - Users can save their passwords along with the associated website information to a JSON file. The application checks for empty fields before saving.

**Finding Passwords:**
  - The application allows users to search for stored passwords by entering the website name. If found, it displays the associated email and password.

**User Interface Setup:**
  - The application uses `tkinter` to create a GUI with input fields for the website, email and password, as well as buttons for generating passwords, saving and searching.
